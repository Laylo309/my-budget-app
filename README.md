# My Budget App

My Budget App is a capstone project from the fifth module of the Microverse program. With it, we learned how to build applications using the Ruby on Rails framework.

Budget App is a  application that lets you create a user, log in, so that the data is private to them. In this application you will be introduced to your new transactions associated with a category and see the money spent on each category.


Everything will be based on the ERD class diagram presented below.
